; Procedures and reporters for dealing with the whale memory model
; Matthew Dickerson
; v1.0  July 1, 2013

; The days-per-hunting-season global slider divides the year up into number-hunting-seasons "whale hunting seasons", where
; number-hunting-seasons = ceiling ( 365 / days-per-hunting-season ). Each season except possible the last has days-per-period days.
; 
; The whales instance variable memory contains the whale's memory of past hunting experience based on these whale hunting seasons 
; and whale hunting regions.  
; That is, memory contains all of a whale's temporal-spatial memory entries, with memory[i] containing a list of memories for season i.
; Specifically, for 0 â‰¤ i < num-seasons, memory[i] (or entry i in memory) contains a list of memory triples for season i.  
; For each hunting region (not for each patch) a whale has hunted during season i, we have one triple (r,h,w) where:
;    r is the index of the region, 
;    h is the total number of hours hunted,
;    w is the total mass of prey consumed. 
; Each list is sorted increasing order by r. 
; Note that a whale has a list for each season in the year. But within each list, only hunting regions
; where a whale has actually hunted during that season is explicitly listed.
